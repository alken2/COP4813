    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello to whoever is viewing this page. As you can see at the top of the page, my name is Kenneth Alcineus, and I am 18 years old. I go by either Kenneth or Kenny.</p>
    <p>I am a first generation Haitian-American. Both my parents were born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti" target="_blank">Haiti</a>, but I was born in Florida. I have a brother and a sister and I am the oldest of my siblings. We moved from South Florida to North Florida about 15 years ago and we have stayed here ever since.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>I have always enjoyed using and learning about computers. I also enjoy loading custom software on a variety of devices. One project I have done was compiling and flashing a custom BIOS called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreboot" target="_blank">Coreboot</a> from a Raspberry Pi to an old Lenovo ThinkPad. While Coreboot was successfully installed, I later ran into problems so I ended up using a modified version of the laptop's stock BIOS instead.</p>

    <p>I also really like food, whether I am eating it or making it. However, I do admit that I am a picky eater. Not too long ago, I have managed to make some decent lasagna. With lasagna being so difficult to make from scratch, I needed some help from my siblings.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>My goal is to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of North Florida. I may consider pursuing a master's degree if I see great potential in my knowledge of computing and quality of life improving as a result. I have attended St. Johns River State College as a dual enrollment student and graduated with an Associate in Arts degree at the same time of graduating with a high school diploma.</p>
    <p>My degrees and certificates, including planned ones are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="diploma">Ridgeview High School Diploma</li>
      <li class="degree">Saint Johns River State College Associate of Arts</li>
      <li class="certificate">Udemy 'Java In-Depth: Become a Complete Java Engineer!' certification (planned)</li>
